    This app uses the helper subs call some of Butler's APIs.  
    It's not diving too deep into any particular feature, but rather just calls most APIs to show how it's done.


    If unsure what the parameters of the helper subs should look like, this page might be useful.

## Calling the Butler API from Sense app's load script

The demo app `Butler 5.0 - demo app.qvf` is available in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ptarmiganlabs/butler/tree/master/docs/sense_apps).

The app includes examples on how to use many of Butler's REST APIs endpoints.  
It doesn't have much of a user interface (it just shows what API endpoints are enabled) so you should look at the load script to get examples of how to use the Butler APIs.

The app includes a copy of the [helper functions](/docs/reference/sense-helper-subs/) that are also available in the GitHub repository.
