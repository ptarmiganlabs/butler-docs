Signl4 offers both an online SaaS service and a mobile app.

The concept looks like this:

1. Alerts (for example an important Sense app fails reloading) are sent to Signl4 using their APIs.  
   Using their API an incident is created.  
   Butler integrates with these APIs, creating a seamless, almost instantaneous handling of incidents.
2. The incident is assigned to whoever is on duty at that time. This person (or group of people in larger organizations) will be notified via their Signl4 mobile apps.
3. The person on duty can acknowledge that an incident is being looked into and eventually also that the incident has been resolved.
4. If no-one acknowledge the incident within a configurable time the incident can be escalated.
5. ... and much more.

The [Getting started section](/docs/getting-started/setup/incident-mgmt-tools/signl4/) has hands-on instructions for setting up Butler to work with Signl4.
