## Data collection

This documentation site was built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and consists of static web pages hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

GitHub probably keep log files for GitHub Pages, your visit to this documentation site is thus likely to be recorded there. I do not have any access to those logs though.

## Google Analytics

Aggregated Google Analytics data may be used to determine, and in some cases publicly communicate, how popular the site is.

No detailed Google Analytics data for this site will be shared with any third parties.

1. Send your request by email to info -at- ptarmiganlabs -dot- com.
