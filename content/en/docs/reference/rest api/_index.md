{{% alert title="Remember" color="warning" %}}
The "Try it out" feature of the API documentation below does not work when accessed from butler.ptarmiganlabs.com. This is only expected as this site does not know anything about where *your* Butler instance is running.

The same feature is however also available from Butler itself, see [this page](/docs/examples/openapi-docs#openapi-documentation-built-into-butler).
