  How to contribute to Butler
---

{{% pageinfo %}}
Butler is an open source project, using the [MIT license](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/).

This means that all source code, documentation etc is available as-is, at no cost.  

**It however also means that anyone interested can - and is encouraged to - contribute to the project!**

Butler is developed in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), with support from various [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) modules.  

We use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to format and generate this documentation site, the [Docsy](https://github.com/google/docsy) theme for styling and site structure.  
Hugo is an open-source static site generator that provides us with templates, content organisation in a standard directory structure, and a website generation engine. You write the pages in Markdown (or HTML if you want), and Hugo wraps them up into a website.

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more information on using pull requests.

If you've found a problem - or have a feature suggestion - with Butler itself or the documentation, but you're not sure how to fix it yourself, please create an issue in the [Butler repo](https://github.com/ptarmiganlabs/butler/issues). You can also create an issue about a specific doc page by clicking the **Create Issue** button in the top right hand corner of the page.
