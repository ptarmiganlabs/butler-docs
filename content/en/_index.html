{{% blocks/feature icon="fa-envelope" title="Task failure notifications" %}}
Who should be the first to know that a reload has failed?  
You or your users?  
Who was it that stopped that important 3-hour reload 5 minutes before it was done?

Get notified when tasks fail or are stopped, with notifications sent to Slack, Microsoft Teams, email, New Relic, Signl4 and other destinations.  
Full support for HTML/Markdown formatting and 40+ template fields.

{{% blocks/feature icon="fa-play" title="Start tasks via REST API or MQTT" %}}
Data delays - no thanks!  
Start reload tasks from within app load scripts or from upstream source systems that feed Sense with data.

Need parameters too? No problem - just add zero or more key-value pairs and they will be available to any Sense app!

Or maybe start all tasks having a certain tag or custom property set? Part of the [REST API](/docs/reference/rest-api/?operationsSorter=alpha?operationsSorter=alpha).

{{% blocks/feature icon="fa-redo" title="Partial app reloads" %}}
Trigger full or partial app reloads using Butler's REST API.

Useful when dealing with reload chains that only should update a subset of an app's data.

{{% blocks/feature icon="fa-shoe-prints" title="App metadata extract" %}}
