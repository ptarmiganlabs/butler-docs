<div class="col-12">
    <h1 class="text-center">A Swiss army knife of data integrations for Qlik Sense</h1>
    <p class="text-center">
    Butler was born out of a need to solve a set of specific challenges around using Qlik Sense together with other software tools.<br><br>

    Initially Butler offered a REST API for sending [Slack](https://slack.com) messages from the Sense load script, 
    but over the years more features have been added and Butler today offers a diverse set of features. <br><br>

    Some features are offered via a REST API (trigger app reloads, send Slack messages, send MQTT pubsub messages etc), 
    while others hook into the Sense logging framework to get notifications when tasks fail, users log on/off or any 
    other log events occur. <br><br>

    The logging framework integration is pretty interesting: It makes it easier to get notifications from Sense *as they happen*, 
    rather than minutes or hours later (as might be the case when relying on polling APIs or reloading the Operations Monitor app).
