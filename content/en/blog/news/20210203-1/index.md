Nothing really major, but it should make the process of getting started with Butler a bit easier:

* Added [instructions](/docs/getting-started/setup/data-connections/) for creating the Sense data connections needed to use Butler.
* Added [examples](/docs/examples/file-copy-move-delete/) showing how file copy/move/delete operations can be done from Sense load scripts using Butler's APIs.
