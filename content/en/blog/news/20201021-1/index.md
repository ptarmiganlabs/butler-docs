Version 4 of Butler is a major release, and the doc site isn't quite as complete as it should.
Over coming weeks we'll add more tutorials, reference documents etc.

The current update adds the following:

* A [system overview diagram](/docs/getting-started/overview/#conceptual-overview).
* More comprehensive description of [use cases](/docs/about/use-cases/).
* Description of how the [data (optionally) stored in InfluxDB](/docs/getting-started/operations/#monitoring-butler) can be used in [day 2 operations](/docs/getting-started/operations/).
* Various typos fixed.
