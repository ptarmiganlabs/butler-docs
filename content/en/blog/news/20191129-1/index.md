New docs, blog and news coming to Butler.
{{< /imgproc >}}

The old doc site was ok, but a few years old and pretty outdated when it came to examples in particular. It was also kind of difficult to maintain, resulting in - no surpise - few updates over the years.

Butler joins its sibling [Butler SOS](https://butler-sos.ptarmiganlabs.com), with both tools now having their own, dedicated doc sites based on the great [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) tool, using the [Docsy](https://www.docsy.dev/) template.

The new site has plenty of room for structured growth, allowing us to add examples, tutorials etc in a good way.

It's also easy for anyone to provide feedback - just click the "Create issue" link in the upper right corner of each page, and are taken straight to the issues section on GitHub. Easy!
