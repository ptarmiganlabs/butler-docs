**Fixing broken start Sense task API endpoint**

Oops. The API endpoint for starting Sense tasks was incorrectly documented, as noted in [#89](https://github.com/ptarmiganlabs/butler/issues/89).
Fixed in version 4.1.1.

Please see the [changelog](https://github.com/ptarmiganlabs/butler/blob/master/changelog.md) for more information.
