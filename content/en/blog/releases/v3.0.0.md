As Butler offers a set of rather different API endpoints, there might be cases where you only need some of those features.

In the spirit of security you might then want to enable only the endpoints you actually need.  
Butler 3.0 adds exactly this feature.

Configuration is easy. Just enable/disable the individual REST API endpoints in Butler's configuration file, and you're done. Done!
