## Key-value refinement

Small release, this.

After using the key-value (KV) store over a few months it became obvious that iterating over keys in namespaces was useful and important. But not possible given the APIs exposed by Butler.

So we added a new one. Given a KV namespace it simply returns the keys in it.

## Bug fixes

We're always looking out for less than optimal solutions in Butler and try to fix them when we get a chance. 
A few of those in this relelase too.
