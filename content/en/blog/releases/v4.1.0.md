**File copying via Butler's REST API**

This is a small release that just adds a single endpoint to Butler's REST API: Copying files.

This is done in the same way as the moving files feature that was added in v4.0:

In the config file you define pairs of approved source/destination directories, between which file copying is allowed.
This way the security risk is greatly reduced, and file copying can become an integral part of Qlik Sense load scripts' logic.

Please see the [changelog](https://github.com/ptarmiganlabs/butler/blob/master/changelog.md) for more information.
