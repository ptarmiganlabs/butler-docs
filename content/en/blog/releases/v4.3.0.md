## Great features are useless if no one uses them

The previous couple of Butler releases included new features (in the form of REST API endpoints) for among other things copying/moving/deleting files in a controlled way.

The problem was that there were no examples showing how to use those new features.  
That is fixed in this release, together with a general cleanup of this documentation site, a few bug fixes ([this one](https://github.com/ptarmiganlabs/butler/issues/114) was a bit nasty..) and minor improvements and tweaks in Butler itself.

Please see the [changelog](https://github.com/ptarmiganlabs/butler/blob/master/changelog.md) for more information.

Butler releases are [available on GitHub](https://github.com/ptarmiganlabs/butler/releases).
