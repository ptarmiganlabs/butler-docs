## Template fields

Butler uses the [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) library for templating work.

Handlebars offers a lot of useful features (nested template fields, evaluation context, template comments) and it's recommended that you browse through at least the [language features](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/#installation) section of their getting started guide to get a feeling for what's possible.

Different Butler monitoring features offer different template fields.  
For example, the template fields available for reload alerts are different from the ones available for monitoring Windows services.
