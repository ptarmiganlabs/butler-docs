**Deprecated feature**


This feature was removed from Butler in version 7.0.

The reason is that Butler's sibling project [Butler SOS](https://butler-sos.ptarmiganlabs.com) focuses on monitoring of Qlik Sense servers and is the best possible home for anything relating to real-time monitoring of Sense environments.

Butler SOS has a very complete feature set when it comes to monitoring - check it out!
