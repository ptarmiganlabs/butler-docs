    Butler handles reload alerts from both client-managed Qlik Sense and Qlik Sense Cloud.


    The same kind of message templates are used, meaning that the look and feel of the alerts are the same regardless of where the alert originated. 


    This can be of particular interest for companies with a hybrid setup or that are in the process of migrating from client-managed to cloud-based Qlik Sense.

    
    Getting the same kind of alerts from both environments can make it easier to understand what's going on.
