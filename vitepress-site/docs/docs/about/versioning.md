# Versions

Features are added, bugs fixed. How are Butler versions set?

## Semantic versioning

Butler follows the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) 2.0.0 specification (SemVer).

Version numbers include up to 3 levels, for example version 4.6.2 (which is a fictitious version):

4 is the **major** version. It is increased when Butler has added major new features, or in other ways changed in major ways. If following this principle, breaking changes should always result in a bumped major version.

6 is the **minor** version. This indicates a smaller update, when one or a few minor features have been added.

2 is the **patch** level. When individual bugs are fixed, these are released with an increased patch level.

Note 1: Major and minor updates usually include bug fixes too.  
Note 2: If a version of 5.2 is mentioned, this implicitly means 5.2.0.
