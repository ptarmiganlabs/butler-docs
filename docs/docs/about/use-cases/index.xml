      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some features age with grace, others don&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Here&amp;rsquo;s a list of features that are candidates for removal from Butler, or that have already been removed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;candidates-for-removal-in-coming-versions&#34;&gt;Candidates for removal in coming versions&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;real-time-metrics-around-active-users&#34;&gt;Real-time metrics around active users&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While a good idea in theory, Butler just wasn&amp;rsquo;t the vehicle for this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The way Butler approached this was to have Sense&amp;rsquo;s log4net logging framework send UDP messages to Butler when users logged in/out or sessions started/ended. This certainly works (quite well in fact!), but it also has inherent issues.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;For example, when Butler was started it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t capture currently active users or sessions - it was only after some event captured in the logs that Butler would update it&amp;rsquo;s internal counters. This meant that it would take some time (sometimes quite long) until the metrics were even approaching the real number of users using Sense.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
