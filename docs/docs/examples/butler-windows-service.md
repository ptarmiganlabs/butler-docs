# Run Butler as a Windows service

If running Butler on a Windows computer it is possible to install Butler as a Windows service.

This means that Butler will start automatically when the computer starts, and will run in the background without any user interaction.

A blog post on [ptarmiganlabs.com](https://ptarmiganlabs.com/the-lazy-qlik-developer-2-setting-up-butler-sos/) goes through the steps required to install _Butler SOS_ as a Windows service, the steps needed for _Butler_ are virtually identical.

This topic is is also discussed on the [Day 2 operations](/docs/getting-started/operations/) page.
